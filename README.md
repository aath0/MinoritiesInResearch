## What is the goal of this project

#### The problem
* Research is mostly governed by Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic individuals, leaving the vast majority of population underrepresented.
* Moreover, most studies are goverened by a divide between researchers and participants: reseachers design studies and make all key decisions. Although participants' views and needs may be totally different, they are rarely consulted! 

##### Our goal
* Our goal is to collectively design a [questionnaire](https://www.soscisurvey.de/URM_pilot/?act=pzyR1NETeO49OoHtnamDiuNw) and use it to evaluate how members of underrepresented minorities perceive research that directly concerns them.
* The questionnaire will be addressed to members of geographical, cultural, gender, sexual or other minority groups and it will evaluate to which extent individuals find research done in their communities respectful, useful and ethical.
