# Contributing to "Minorities in Research"

Many thanks for your interest in this project! :relaxed: :tada: :unicorn:

We are trying to collectively design a questionnaire for evaluating how members of underrepresented minorities see the research that directly concerns them. We welcome new contributors and will be delighted to have your input! Bellow is a list of guidelines for helping in this project.
Please keep in mind that these are just guidelines, not rules! We particularly welcome new ideas or different perspectives!
