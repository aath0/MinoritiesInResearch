## Bellow you can find feedback that anonymous users have left on the [beta version of the survey](https://www.soscisurvey.de/URM_pilot/index.php?i=IW1758YBVLGI&rnd=AILC)

*****

Section 1:
SD06 - maybe identify that this is personal information? And a reminder of confidentiality would be good to add here.

SD06 - I don't know what 'Other school-leaving qualification:' means?

A001 - what qualifies as an academic study? how do I know if it was academic?

A002 - what are study participants? is this online or offline? A bit confused by this question*

A007 - you should encourage the survey respondent to 'select all that'. Also, I feel like I agree with so many of these responses but didn't classify them as disrespectful until now. I assume I will not know coverage or results of most studies.

A008 - what do you mean by exemplary? I don't understand so it's a blocker when answering the question and all following it.

U005 - I find that scientific and academic research are interchanged in the survey and don't know the difference or what you are really focusing on. More info at the beginning would have been helpful.

U003 - I find it difficult when I answer no to a question and then I get all these follow-up questions about my answers (which I assume are for people who say yes). Is there a way to hide those and only share to people who say yes? I don't know what to do when I get to them and it's not intuitive to skip them if you said no.
Great research topic - such important work to dig into.
